= Introduction =

The <b>struts2-jquery-plugin</b> is a Struts2 plugin that ajax-enables many struts tags using the
jQuery javascript library.

The goal is to provide a highly functional yet very lightweight ajax plugin for the struts2 framework.

The framework will focus on providing the most useful ajax features for the most common UI tags and widgets.

=== Basic Usage === 

To use the struts2-jquery tags

  # Include the [http://code.google.com/p/struts2-jquery-plugin/source/browse/ struts2-jquery-plugin.jar] in your application classpath
  # Include the struts jquery tag library on your jsp page (<font color='#6c6c6c'><%@ taglib prefix="sj" uri="/struts2-jquery-tags" %></font>)
  # Include the <sj:head> tag in the head of your jsp page
  # Use the ajax enable struts2 tags <sj:xxxx> tags.
