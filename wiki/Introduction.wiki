sturts2-jquery-plugin is a Struts2 plugin that ajax-enables many struts tags using the
jQuery javascript library.

The goal is to provide a highly functional yet very lightweight ajax plugin for the struts2 framework.

=== Tags ===
  * *[[div]]* - Allowing dynamically loading content into any div
  * *[[anchor]]* - Provides links for form submission and remote content loading using ajax. Integrated with the *div* tag as remote content containers
  * *[[submit]]* - Provides buttons for form submission and remote content loading using ajax<br/> Integrated with the *div* tag as remote content containers
  * *[[bind]]* - Generic binding tag to add standard ajax functionality to a variety of components

=== Widgets ===
  * *[[tabbedPane]]* - A tabbed pane widget that allows for remote and dynamic loading, reloading, selecting etc. of tabs
  * *[[datepicker]]* - TBD
